PriorityMutex :

Challanges which influences the idea :
Mutex are never biased regarding competeing threads, hence even if a high priority thread came up to lock an mutex, 
it may not get the mutex immediately. 
In worst case, in scenario where there are lots of low priority threads and single priority thread, 
the priority thread may need to wait considerable time to lock the mutex.

In real life scenarios, we need priority tasks to be completed before low priority task.
As normal mutex does not bias, hence only with mutex, it is difficult to achieve biased behaviou between tasks.

The Concept :
There could be a mutex, which allow threds to success in locking based on its priority. For example :
Higher priority thread will always get more chances to be successful on locking
Lower priority thred should not suffer limitless because of this bias.
